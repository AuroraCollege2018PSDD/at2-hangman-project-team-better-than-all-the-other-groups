This is the design brief for sprint 1 of our project.

the goal of this sprint is to create a working, simple, text based game, similar but not limited to hangman. First we must sit down and decide the specifics of this game.

How long will the words be, how many lives will the player get, what will the difficulty of this game be. 

We must then create flow charts of this program to define how exactly it will work. Then we will desk check everything before we begin programming the game.

Once programming is complete we will breifly test to ensure no major flaws in the system.

Than meet with client to discuss additions, removals and graphics.
