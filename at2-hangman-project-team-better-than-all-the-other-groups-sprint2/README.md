# AT2-Major-Project
Major Project is to develop a Graphical Hangman Game using pygame

## Overview
You will be working in groups of two to three students to create a simple game for a client.
 
We will use a modified version of the agile approach with the process broken down into manageable tasks.
 
There will be client consultation meetings on Tue Week 3 and Thu Week 5. These will set the criteria for 3 sprints finishing Tue Week 5; Tue Week 8 and Thu Week 10. At the end of each sprint you need to convene a meeting with the client. It will be your responsibility to 'book' this but unless there are exceptional circumstances these should be in each Thursday class.
 
The project must be handed in by end of the school day (4 pm) on Thu Week 10 or as those of you familiar with [ISO 8610] (https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) (an I hope that's all of you) then the hand in time is 2018-07-05T 06:00:00+10:00.

## Submission

All work is to be submitted in this repository. All documents listed under other project components should be in the docs folder. All images or sound that the program uses should be in the media folder. All test data should be in the test folder.

You should create a separate fork for each sprint and and then creat a pull request which will allow you to start a discussion with your team. Every time you make significant changes to a file you should do a commit and make sure you give a detailed description of:
* the changes you made
* the reason for those changes
* and future changes you need to make usually indicated with the words TODO
* and changes that need to be made to any files as a result of these changes
These descriptions constitute a log book or diary of your work.

At the end of each sprint your team will make a merge request and merge the fork back to the master repo.

All files need to be clearly labelled with a name that indicates what the file is, for example 'data_dictionary.pdf', 'storyboard.png' etc. I don't want to have to go searching for them.
